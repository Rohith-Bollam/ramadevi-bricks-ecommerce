## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. 🧮 Custom "Brick Math" Calculator
- **Problem:** Customers often know their wall size (sq. ft.) but struggle to estimate the material quantity.
- **Solution:** Engineered a custom JavaScript algorithm that accepts `Length` × `Height` inputs and automatically calculates the exact brick count needed.

### 2. 💰 Dynamic Tiered Pricing Engine
- Implemented logic to adjust unit costs in real-time based on order volume:
  - **Standard:** ₹40/unit (1-500 bricks)
  - **Bulk:** ₹39/unit (501-2000 bricks)
  - **Wholesale:** ₹38/unit (2000+ bricks)

### 3. 📍 Logistics & Lead Gen
- **Google Maps API:** Integrated direct navigation to the manufacturing unit in Jangaon.
- **WhatsApp API:** Added a floating "Chat Now" button that pre-fills a sales inquiry message for instant lead generation.
